The nodes

The nodes executing our containers run a collection of services:
    - a container Engine (typically Docker)
    - kubelet (the "node agent")
    - kube-proxy (a necessary but not sufficient network component)
Nodes were formerly called "minions"
    - (You might see that word in older articles or documentation)




The control plane

The Kubernetes logic (its "brains") is a collection of services:
- the API server (our point of entry to everything!)
- core services like the scheduler and controller manager
- etcd (a highly available key/value store; the "database" of Kubernetes)

- Together, these services form the control plane of our cluster
- The control plane is also called the "master"

When we talk about the masters, I like to refer to it as the control plane because it may be one or more master nodes, and control plane refers to all those services that are in control of the cluster.
