## Terms
Docker image and container image are the same term for the same thing.

## Commands
```
// -it means
// The t gives us a pseudo tty or a prompt similar to what you would have through ssh.
// The i allows us to keep that session open so that we can keep running more commands.
docker container run -it

// bash shell with -it, will give you a terminal inside the running container
docker container run -it proxy nginx bash

// If we exit the bash shell
// The containers only run as long as the command that it ran on startup runs. Since we changed it to Bash, simply exiting Bash quit it
exit
```


:::info what's Alpine? 

We haven't mentioned Alpine before. Alpine is another distribution of Linux, but Alpine is designed to be very small.

It's actually only 5MB in size. If I do a docker pull alpine, that will pull down the latest Alpine image and if I do a docker image
