## What Does Decoupled Mean?

Decoupled, or decoupling, is a state of an IT environment in which two or more systems somehow work or are connected without being directly connected.

In a decoupled microservices architecture, for example, software services have none or very little knowledge about the other services. In theory, this means that a change can be made to one service without the developer having to worry about how the change will impact other services -- as long as the service's application programming interface (API) remains the same.

A decoupled architecture allows software development teams to **build, execute, test and debug application modules independently**. This approach also allows each module to be developed and maintained by a different team of software developers.
