## VPC Flow Logs

VPC Flow Logs - VPC Flow Logs is a feature that enables you to *capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC*. Flow log data can be published to Amazon CloudWatch Logs or Amazon S3. After you've created a flow log, you can retrieve and view its data in the chosen destination.

You can create a flow log for a VPC, a subnet, or a network interface. If you create a flow log for a subnet or VPC, each network interface in that subnet or VPC is monitored.

Flow log data for a monitored network interface is recorded as flow log records, which are log events consisting of fields that describe the traffic flow.


## CloudWatch Event Rules

You can use Amazon CloudWatch Events to detect and react to changes in the state of a pipeline, stage, or action. Then, based on rules you create, CloudWatch Events invokes one or more target actions when a pipeline, stage, or action enters the state you specify in a rule. 

Examples of Amazon CloudWatch Events rules and targets:



* A rule that sends a notification when the *instance state changes*, where an EC2 instance is the event source, and Amazon SNS is the event target.
* A rule that sends a notification when the *build phase changes*, where a CodeBuild configuration is the event source, and Amazon SNS is the event target.
* A rule that detects *pipeline changes* and invokes an AWS Lambda function.


## CloudWatch can’t help to debug microservices specific issues on AWS. Use X-ray!

**Q:** A company uses microservices-based infrastructure to process the API calls from clients, perform request filtering and cache requests using the AWS API Gateway. Users report receiving 501 error code and you have been contacted to find out what is failing.

**A:** Use X-Ray service

* CloudWatch can collect numbers and respond to AWS service-related events, but it can't help you debug microservices specific issues on AWS.
* X-Ray cannot be used to capture metrics and set up alarms as per the given use-case, so this option is incorrect.

The AWS X-Ray SDK needs permission to run in resources (like Lambda)

Create an IAM role with write permissions and assign it to the resources running your application. You can use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to grant X-Ray permissions to users and compute resources in your account. This should be one of the first places you start by checking that your permissions are properly configured before exploring other troubleshooting options.

Here is an example of X-Ray Read-Only permissions via an IAM policy:


```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "xray:GetSamplingRules",
                "xray:GetSamplingTargets",
                "xray:GetSamplingStatisticSummaries",
                "xray:BatchGetTraces",
                "xray:GetServiceGraph",
                "xray:GetTraceGraph",
                "xray:GetTraceSummaries",
                "xray:GetGroups",
                "xray:GetGroup"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```


Another example of write permissions for using X-Ray via an IAM policy:


```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "xray:PutTraceSegments",
                "xray:PutTelemetryRecords",
                "xray:GetSamplingRules",
                "xray:GetSamplingTargets",
                "xray:GetSamplingStatisticSummaries"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```



## CloudTail

If you have created an organization in AWS Organizations, you can also create a trail that will log all events for all AWS accounts in that organization (need root account permission). This is referred to as an organization trail.



* S3 related
    * By default, CloudTrail tracks only bucket-level actions. To track object-level actions, you need to enable Amazon S3 data events 
    * A bucket owner enabled CloudTrail. It doesn’t mean he can see the object access logs. The bucket owner also needs to be object owner to get the object access logs. Otherwise, the bucket owner must get permissions, through the object ACL, for the same object API to get the same object-access API logs.
* Member accounts will be able to see the organization trail, but cannot modify or delete it. (By default, member accounts will not have access to the log files for the organization trail in the Amazon S3 bucket.)
