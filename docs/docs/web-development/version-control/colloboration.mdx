## Tracking branch
The branch that appears in the local repository tracking a branch in the remote repository. (normally it's called origin/master branch, but you can change the name)

### Clone VS Fork: 
Forking is an action that's done on a hosting service, like GitHub. **Forking** a repository creates *an identical copy* of the original repository and moves this copy to your account. You have total control over this forked repository. Modifying your forked repository does not alter the original repository in any way.

Do you require a copy of a project, and do not need to sync your copy with the original project? If so, a **clone** is more suitable because it does not share a connection with the original repository.



### Fetch VS Pull
`git pull` is the same thing as a `git fetch` + `git merge`!
One main point when you want to use git fetch rather than git pull is if your remote branch and your local branch both have changes that neither of the other ones has.

In this case, you want to fetch the remote changes to get them in your local branch and then perform a merge manually. Then you can push that new merge commit back to the remote.

### Origin vs Upstream Clarification
- When Clone: Git created a connection for us automatically and gave this connection a short name of **origin** when we clone a project. We can manually set up a connection to the original or source remote repository, though. Typically, we'd name the short name **upstream**.
- When Fork: What might be confusing is that origin does not refer to the source repository (also known as the "original" repository) that we forked from. Instead, it's pointing to our forked repository. So even though it has the word **origin** is not actually the original repository.
- You can actually change the name of **origin** to **mine** and the name of **upstream** to **source-repo**.
-Github suggest fork a repo on GitHub before cloning that fork locally

![origin and upstream](/img/web-development/version-control/origin_and_upstream.png)
> When a repo is cloned, it has a default remote called **origin** that points to your fork on GitHub, not the original repo it was forked from.
> To keep track of the original repo, you need to add another remote named **upstream**.
`git remote add upstream git://github.com/<original creator>/<original creator repo.>`

## What is a remote in Git?
A remote in Git is a common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes. In most cases, such a remote repository is stored on a code hosting service like GitHub or on an internal server.

In contrast to a local repository, a remote typically does not provide a file tree of the project's current state. Instead, it only consists of the .git versioning data.

### Remote init
```bash
# Show remote details:
`git remote -v`

# Clone to localhost:
git clone https://github.com/user/project.git
# OR
`git clone ssh://user@domain.com/~/dir/.git

# Clone to localhost folder:
git clone https://github.com/user/project.git ~/dir/folder

# Clone specific branch to localhost:
git clone -b branchname https://github.com/user/project.git

# Clone with token authentication (in CI environment):
git clone https://oauth2:<token>@gitlab.com/username/repo.git
```

### Remote setup
```bash
# Add remote upstream from GitHub project:
git remote add upstream https://github.com/user/project.git

# Add remote upstream from existing empty project on server:
git remote add upstream ssh://root@123.123.123.123/path/to/repository/.git

# Fetch:
git fetch upstream

# Fetch a custom branch:
git fetch upstream branchname:local_branchname

# Merge fetched commits:
git merge upstream/master

# Remove origin:
git remote rm origin

# Show remote branches:
git branch -r

# Show all branches (remote and local):
git branch -a

# Create and checkout branch from a remote branch:
git checkout -b local_branchname upstream/remote_branchname

# Compare:
git diff origin/master..master
```


### Remote operation
```bash
# Push (set default with `-u`):
git push -u origin master

# Push:
git push origin master

# Force-Push:
git push origin master --force

# Delete remote branch (push nothing):
git push origin :branchname or:
git push origin --delete branchname

# Pull:
git pull

# Pull specific branch:
git pull origin branchname

# Fetch a pull request on GitHub by its ID and create a new branch:
git fetch upstream pull/ID/head:new-pr-branch
```
