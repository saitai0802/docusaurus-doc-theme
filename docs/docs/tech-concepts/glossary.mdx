## What does LTS mean?
LTS stands for long term support. Here, support means that throughout the lifetime of a release there is a commitment to update, patch and maintain the software. For an LTS, there is a shorter development cycle, where engineers and contributors add to the body of the release. And a longer beta testing cycle, where more testing and bug fixing takes place to focus on a release’s performance and stability. 

Without long term support, software can become a security risk. Vulnerabilities develop over time and without mechanisms to patch or update them, systems become exposed and perform worse the longer they remain out-of-date. 

On the other hand, if users stick with the same release too long their system will start to fall behind. While some key features are occasionally backported to old releases, development moves forward. The latest is typically the greatest.

## Company's IP 

Intellectual property – or IP – refers to anything that has been created, like designs, inventions, brand names, and literary works.

IP is protected by law, for example through copyright, patents, and trade marks, so the author has sole authorisation over who can use and distribute their work.

Businesses take reasonable steps to protect fixed assets, like their stock and equipment. But intangible assets can be more difficult to secure.

Intellectual property (IP) is an intangible asset. Your IP isn’t physical in nature, but patents, trade marks and copyrights can all add value to your business.

## Workflow 

### SOP

Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are written documents or work instructions that detail all of the steps involved in a procedure or process. The SOP development services include end-to-end level mapping of processes and formatting SOPs to your template and organization structures.

The basis of Standard Operating Procedures is about systematizing processes and documenting them. Organizational activities and operations are aligned to work in accordance to industrial regulations and governmental regulations with the help of SOPs. It distinctly defines the roles and responsibilities of workers by proving descriptions of who does what and when, allowing for accountability and consistency throughout the workplace.

### SOW

Statement of Work (SOW) is a project management document that regulates the cooperation between two companies. Usually, it is part of the contract or a service agreement. Statement of Work defines and clarifies every aspect of the project, including schedules, terms, work standards, payment method, as well as acceptance criteria for deliveries. 

As a matter of fact, a high-quality SOW should cover every critical point of the work.

### WIP

The term work-in-progress (WIP) is a production and supply-chain management term describing partially finished goods awaiting completion. WIP refers to the raw materials, labor, and overhead costs incurred for products that are at various stages of the production process.

In software development WIP is the number of tasks one developer is working on in a specific moment.

## SKU

![sow](/img/tech-concepts/sku.webp)

A SKU (pronounced “skew”) stands for Stock Keeping Unit. A retailer typically uses SKUs to identify their business’s inventory.

Most retailers know that SKUs help track products from [vendor](https://www.shopify.co.uk/retail/vendor-sourcing) to customer, but few know how they work behind the scenes and why they’re so important.

## Cloud computing

### SaaS

Software as a service (SaaS) is a software distribution model in which a cloud provider hosts applications and makes them available to end users over the internet. In this model, an independent software vendor (ISV) may contract a third-party cloud provider to host the application. Or, with larger companies, such as Microsoft, the cloud provider might also be the software vendor.

SaaS is one of three main categories of cloud computing, alongside infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS). A range of IT professionals, business users and personal users use SaaS applications.

#### Examples
| Platform Type | Common Examples                                                                                                         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SaaS          | Google Workspace, Dropbox, Salesforce, Outlook, Hotmail, Yahoo! , Concur, GoToMeeting                                                 |
| PaaS          | AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Windows Azure, Heroku, Force.com, Google App Engine, Apache Stratos, OpenShift                   |
| IaaS          | DigitalOcean, Linode, Rackspace, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Cisco Metapod, Microsoft Azure, Google Compute Engine (GCE) |

If you’ve used a web-based email service such as Outlook, Hotmail or Yahoo! Email, then you’ve already used a form of SaaS. With these services, you log into your account over the Internet, often from a web browser. The email software is located on the service provider’s network, where your messages are also stored. You can access your email and stored messages from a web browser on any computer or Internet-connected device.

The previous examples are free services for personal use. For organisational use, you can rent productivity apps, such as email, collaboration and calendaring, and sophisticated business applications such as customer relationship management (CRM), enterprise resource planning (ERP) and document management. You pay for the use of these apps by subscription or according to the level of use.

## Database

### Data Catalog

The earliest challenges that inhibited building a data lake were keeping track of all of the raw assets as they were loaded into the data lake, and then tracking all of the new data assets and versions that were created by data transformation, data processing, and analytics. Thus, an essential component of a data lake built on Amazon S3 is the Data Catalog. The Data Catalog provides an interface to query all assets stored in data lake S3 buckets. The Data Catalog is designed to provide a single source of truth about the contents of the data lake.
