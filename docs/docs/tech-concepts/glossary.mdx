## What does LTS mean?
LTS stands for long term support. Here, support means that throughout the lifetime of a release there is a commitment to update, patch and maintain the software. For an LTS, there is a shorter development cycle, where engineers and contributors add to the body of the release. And a longer beta testing cycle, where more testing and bug fixing takes place to focus on a release’s performance and stability. 

Without long term support, software can become a security risk. Vulnerabilities develop over time and without mechanisms to patch or update them, systems become exposed and perform worse the longer they remain out-of-date. 

On the other hand, if users stick with the same release too long their system will start to fall behind. While some key features are occasionally backported to old releases, development moves forward. The latest is typically the greatest.

## Company's IP 

Intellectual property – or IP – refers to anything that has been created, like designs, inventions, brand names, and literary works.

IP is protected by law, for example through copyright, patents, and trade marks, so the author has sole authorisation over who can use and distribute their work.

Businesses take reasonable steps to protect fixed assets, like their stock and equipment. But intangible assets can be more difficult to secure.

Intellectual property (IP) is an intangible asset. Your IP isn’t physical in nature, but patents, trade marks and copyrights can all add value to your business.

## Statement of Work (SOW)

SOW is a project management document that regulates the cooperation between two companies. Usually, it is part of the contract or a service agreement. Statement of Work defines and clarifies every aspect of the project, including schedules, terms, work standards, payment method, as well as acceptance criteria for deliveries. 

As a matter of fact, a high-quality SOW should cover every critical point of the work.

## Work-in-Progress (WIP)

The term work-in-progress (WIP) is a production and supply-chain management term describing partially finished goods awaiting completion. WIP refers to the raw materials, labor, and overhead costs incurred for products that are at various stages of the production process.

In software development WIP is the number of tasks one developer is working on in a specific moment.
