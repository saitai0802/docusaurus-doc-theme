## iSCSI

### Analogy

Imagine you have a big box where you can keep all your toys and games. Now, think of iSCSI block storage as a magical box that is far away, but you can still use it to store and access your toys and games.

Instead of keeping your toys physically in the box, you pretend they are inside the magical box, and whenever you want to play with a specific toy, you use a special magical remote control called "iSCSI" to bring that toy to you. The iSCSI remote control knows how to connect to the magical box far away, and it can move toys in and out of it as if they were right there with you.

This way, you can have access to your toys and games from anywhere you want, just like you have them with you all the time. It's like having a big toy room far away that you can use whenever you like, without actually having to carry all the toys with you. That's how iSCSI block storage works, like magic storage that lets you keep and use your stuff even when it's not right next to you!
