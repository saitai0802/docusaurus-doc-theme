## What is Orchestration 

> TL;DR - Orchestration is designed to automate change and monitor the state of things and ensure everything is the state you expect it to be. (eg; health state)

 Orchestration is probably best described using an example. Letâ€™s say that you have an application that has high traffic along with high-availability requirements. Due to these requirements, you typically want to deploy across at least 3+ machines, so that in the event a host fails, your application will still be accessible from at least two others. Obviously, this is just an example and your use-case will likely have its own requirements, but you get the idea.

Deploying your application without Orchestration is typically very time consuming and error prone, because you would have to manually SSH into each machine, start up your application, and then continually keep tabs on things to make sure it is running as you expect.

But, with Orchestration tooling, you can typically off-load much of this manual work and let automation do the heavy lifting. One cool feature of Orchestration with Docker Swarm, is that you can deploy an application across many hosts with only a single command (once Swarm mode is enabled). Plus, if one of the supporting nodes dies in your Docker Swarm, other nodes will automatically pick up load, and your application will continue to hum along as usual.
