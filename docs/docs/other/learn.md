## Technical areas

Below are some approaches that how the good technical person to learn new stuff. 

- Learning K8s with only command lines and API docs with out Googling. This approach is inspired by [Kelsey hightower
/Kubernetes The Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way)
- [Bret Fisher](https://www.bretfisher.com/)
    - I'm going to be starting with the documentation with the samples. Also, using the generated YAML from the command line using the `kubectl create`. 
    - Then, I'm going to start using these other scratch commands to fill in my gaps and to understand new fields that I should put into my resource and to make it do what I need it to do.
