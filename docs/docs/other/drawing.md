## Basic of drawing

### Elements to handle

- Size, Placement
- proportion
- Relationship (ratio)

### Angle
- Keep stepping backward with the same angle as you draw. 
- The purpose is to zoom out to compare the objects and your drawing.
- Remember, if you draw the object in an aerial view, you need to fly to the sky to zoom out. (which is of course impossible). The point is - you have to keep the same angle.


### Notes

- **Try to increase visual memory**. From a few second to few minutes and even longer. So that you don't need to keep stepping backward to check.
- **Curve** If you draw a line, you can put the starting point A and ending point B. For a circle, you can't do so, you can put infinite points on it.
- There are 2 types of drawing training, visusal(perceptual) and conceptual(sculpture). Visual training is drawing via your eyes and all about lines. Conceptual training is drawing via your brain and logical construct the object. The benifit is you don't need to see the object to draw. You can imagine it and even draw the object in the other angle.
- Envolope drawing vs 一格格分線。 You can actually mix these 2 approaches in your drawing.

### Common mistakes

- We tend to zoom in one small thing to omit a big picture. Always zoom out to check
- You are not only drawing the object, but also the outer space of the object.
- Don't adjust the bottom and top line to adjust the ratio. Always adjust things that inside your frame.

## Different Values

### 2 Level

- Charcoal control
- Shadow, at this level. We only need to due with 2 level, black and empty. 
- Find the shape of light and shadow
- Drawing the ratio right at the first place is so important before drawing the details

### 5 Level

light
shadow

### Introducing white

You don't need lines to describe an object, instead, use the colour contracts.
