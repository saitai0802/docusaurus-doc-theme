## Why do people question your thought?

People question others when  
- your thinking is not deep enough
- you lack confidence

### Thinking is not deep enough 

Usually people who don't think deep enough is because they trust whatever they heard. They don't challenge the content they receive, what even worse is they convinced by the mistaken information. When you don't have the right knowledge, people won't trust you.

**Practice**
Try to explain what you have thought to a third party as a practice. Discuss they points that they think are not comprehensive to confirm what you've missed. Repeat this process a certain times, then you will be able to understand which type of questions you have neglected.

When doing this practise, you need to find people who can explain their opinion clearly, if you don't you will probably get the responds like: `umm yea`, `that is probably right` or  `maybe your thought works` which are not beneficial to discovery the  blindspots of your thoughts.

### Lack of confidence

People who lack confidence usually because they weren't complimented by parents/teachers or always were reprimanded. If people who don't have parent's affection in their childhood, it's different to use a positive or affirmative way to look at themselves. Even worse is after graduated, you got beat down your at work 

There are lots of ways to rebuild your confidence, but in term of having the confidence to let the people listen and trust what you said. The solution would be

**Solution**

Be prepared yourself and be able to construct a strategy when people challenge you. If you can do only this point, you will be able to avoid the situations where you are stunned by the others.    

- Learn things in-depth. It is all about determination 
- Think deeply. If you think deeply about what you say, even the challenger may question the authenticity of their questions.
- Simulate the questions the audience may ask based on their mindset and situation
## Develop the habit of thinking at all times

The first thing to develop the habit of thinking is to find a topic that you feel interested 

Accepting all the information without thinking makes you shallow. Try to verify the information in various ways to check the opposite ideas, it helps you to make your own decision.

Through the iteration of giving your own opinion, your own idea will be quenched. From a vague ideas to be a more solid one. In each iteration, you can reinforce your memory and confidence.

The attitude of leisurely answering questions means dealing with questions in a neither humble nor arrogant way.

Jotting notes
- Don't need to overthinking, jot down the things come to mind within one minute.
- Because you don't have the time to think, you will jot down the things intuitively.
- It helps organsining your mind and venting emotions. After venting emotions, thinking will become easy and less stressed.
- Without doubt and anxiety, confidence will be grown naturally

## Establish your own opinion, train tha ability to response when giving a speech

Don't say 'this topic is not my expertise' as an excuse to not thinking. Try to think about everything even when the topic is not what you are good at.

Intentionally make a situation where you can exchange ideas from the others to train the ability of spontaneous response.

When reading information, try to decide **immediately** whether you agree or disagree with the arguments of the information with reasons.
## Prepare notes and rehearsal

Usually people who don't have confidence and have a sense of inferiority tend to make speech complicated . Remember people won't look down you because your idea is concise and easy to understand. The only thing that will be look down is the thinking is shallow.

Steps to prepare your speech:
- Jot down your speech in 4-6 lines 
- Temperately leave your knowledge aside and pretend you are the audience to read the speech
- Get the feedback from the others to see if it's easy to understand
- Modify the speech and reiterate the steps from step 2


- Bear in mind, if the audience doesn't understand what you say, it means you haven't said anything
- Speaking while thinking what message you want to give to the audience, if he/she can understand completely 
- Observe people who are good at share ideas and learn the speaking skills from them 


## Don't mind if you can express your thought in an organized way

- Putting on an act doesn't work. If you truly believe in what you said, you will be able to explain your idea fluently.
- Only emphase 3 points in your speech. You can start speaking even if you have 2 points only and you can think about the third point during your speech though it's difficult. 
- Stay around from people who keep saying, 'Your speak is unorganised', 'If I say that in the organised way, it should be ...', 'how can I understand such unorgainsed speech?'
    - A good manager should encourage the team members to work energetically, instead of the other way round
    - These people usually protects their self-esteem by pointing the other people are unorganised.
    - If you know the problem is not about unorganisated information, the most wised choice should be taking these word like a passing wind.


## When questioned, try to reply that calmly and immediately 

One rule of thumb is, when you've tried your best to answer people's question. Don't need to regret what you've replied or keep thinking a better way to answer it. Instead, change your mood and prepare the next tough question.

If someone keep thinking only their ideas are correct and other's are wrong. These people are the one who holds the company back. To deal with them, you can..

- Do more preparation. So even when they refute what you said, you will only think 'I know you will ask such question' and even use their point to strengthen your argument.
- They just want to make people think they are smart. You can reply them like 'your opinions are great, then can you help to handle xxxx?' To praise their idea while doing things on your way.

### When you don't understand the question

- Don't share your opinions before you understand the question.
- Questions that you can humbly ask when you don't understand
    - In case I make it wrong, are you saying xxxxx?
    - Sorry I don't understand this, can you confirm xxxxx?
    - Could you mind to say that again?
    - Are you asking the xxx? 

## Answer questions immediately 

Answering questions immediately (not even a few seconds) can let the questioners feel your energy and boldness, thus people will think you're reliable due to your confidence. Thus the meeting will be from *query mode* to *confirmation mode*, then it will becomes *acceptance mode*
