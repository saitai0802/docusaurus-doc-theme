## Whe people question you?

People question others when  
- your thinking is not deep enough
- you are lack of confidence

### Thinking is not deep enough 

Usually people who don't think deep enough is because they trust whatever they heard. They don't challenge the content they receive, what even worse is they convinced by the mistaken information. When you don't have the right knowledge, people won't trust you.

**Practice**
Try to explain what you have thought to a third party as a practice. Discuss they points that they think are not comprehensive to confirm what you've missed. Repeat this process a certain times, then you will be able to understand which type of questions you have neglected.

When doing this practise, you need to find people who can explain their opinion clearly, if you don't you will probably get the responds like: `umm yea`, `that is probably right` or  `maybe your thought works` which are not beneficial to discovery the  blindspots of your thoughts.

### Lack of confidence



## Develop the habit of thinking at all times


## Establish your own opinion, train tha ability to response when giving a speech


## Prepare notes and rehearsal


## Don't mind if you can express your thought in an organized way



## When questioned, try to reply that calmly and immediately 



## Understand the meaning behind what people talk



## Train the way how you to solve a problem
