title: Egress and Ingress
---

In networking, the terms "ingress" and "egress" refer to the direction of data flow in relation to a network or a specific network interface. Here are the key differences between ingress and egress:

1. Direction of data flow:
   - Ingress: Refers to the process of data entering a network or interface. It is the data flow from an external source towards the network.
   - Egress: Refers to the process of data leaving a network or interface. It is the data flow from the network towards an external destination.

2. Network perspective:
   - Ingress: Focuses on data entering a network from an external source. It is concerned with the initial entry point of data into the network infrastructure.
   - Egress: Focuses on data leaving a network towards an external destination. It deals with the exit point of data from the network infrastructure.

3. Associated devices and interfaces:
   - Ingress: Occurs at the interface or port where data enters a network. It involves devices such as switches, routers, or firewalls that handle the initial reception and processing of incoming data.
   - Egress: Occurs at the interface or port where data exits a network. It involves devices such as switches, routers, or firewalls that handle the forwarding and transmission of outgoing data.

4. Function and processing:
   - Ingress: Involves tasks such as packet inspection, routing decisions, filtering, and security checks performed on incoming data to determine the appropriate path and enforce policies.
   - Egress: Involves tasks such as routing decisions, forwarding, and applying policies to outgoing data as it leaves the network infrastructure.

5. Data transmission:
   - Ingress: Initiates the process of data transmission by bringing external data into the network.
   - Egress: Finalizes the process of data transmission by sending data out of the network towards its intended destination.

In summary, ingress and egress describe the direction and process of data flow in networking. Ingress refers to data entering a network, while egress refers to data leaving a network. They represent opposite directions in the network communication process.
