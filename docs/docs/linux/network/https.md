## Why we need Https?

### Privacy

> Privacy means that no one can eavesdrop on your messages. HTTPS uses an [encryption](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-encryption/) protocol to encrypt communications. The protocol is called [Transport Layer Security (TLS)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/transport-layer-security-tls/), although formerly it was known as [Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-ssl/). This protocol secures communications by using what's known as an [asymmetric public key infrastructure](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/how-does-public-key-encryption-work/).

Before encryption: `This is a string of text that is completely readable`

After encryption: `ITM0IRyiEhVpa6VnKyExMiEgNveroyWBPlgGyfkflYjDaaFf/Kn3bo3OfghBPDWo6AfSHlNtL8N7ITEwIXc1gU5X73xMsJormzzXlwOyrCs`

### Integrity

> Integrity means that the message is not manipulated on the way to its destination.

In websites without HTTPS, it is possible for Internet service providers (ISPs) or other intermediaries to inject content into webpages without the approval of the website owner. This commonly takes the form of advertising, where an ISP looking to increase revenue injects paid advertising into the webpages of their customers. 

Unsurprisingly, when this occurs, the profits for the advertisements and the quality control of those advertisements are in no way shared with the website owner. HTTPS eliminates the ability of unmoderated third parties to inject advertising into web content.

WHat even worst is hacker can do a man-in-the-middle attack

### Identification

> Identification means that I can check that this message is coming from whom.

And when you are browsing the web, identification means that the site that you are visiting is indeed the one you think it is. This SSL certificate is valid and has been issued by a legitimate Certificate Authority. 


## Handshake

When your brower needs to communicate with a server, they both establish a secure connection to transmit messages, but first, they needed to agree on how to communicate securely.
- If the negotiation is not successful, your browser lets you know by showing an error or warning.
- If an agreement is reached, your browser is happy to display a green padlock on the address bar.

This process, the negotiation between a browser and a server, is called 'the handshake'.

The exact steps within a TLS handshake will vary depending upon the kind of key exchange algorithm used and the **cipher suites supported by both sides. The RSA key exchange algorithm, while now considered not secure, was used in versions of TLS before 1.3. It goes roughly as follows:

1.  **The 'client hello' message**: The client initiates the handshake by sending a "hello" message to the server. The message will include which TLS version the client supports, the cipher suites supported, and a string of random bytes known as the "client random."
2.  **The 'server hello' message**: In reply to the client hello message, the server sends a message containing the server's [SSL certificate](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-an-ssl-certificate/).The server's chosen **cipher suite** (which is the best SSL/TLS version and encryption algorithm among the ones client sent to server, and based on the server preferences), and the "server random," another random string of bytes that's generated by the server.

    - A fancy word for the encryption algorithm list is '**cipher suite**'.
    - Server replies with its certificate, which includes server's public key, so client can verify who the server is.

3. **Client Key Exchange**
    -  **Authentication**: The client verifies the server's SSL certificate with the certificate authority that issued it. This confirms that the server is who it says it is, and that the client is interacting with the actual owner of the domain.
    -  **The premaster secret**: The client sends one more random string of bytes, the "**premaster secret**/**premaster key**." The premaster secret is encrypted with the server's public key and can only be decrypted with the private key by the server. (The client gets the [public key](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/how-does-public-key-encryption-work/) from the server's SSL certificate.)
5.  **Private key used**: The server decrypts the premaster secret.
6.  **Session keys created**: Both client and server generate session keys from the client random, the server random, and the premaster secret. They should arrive at the same results.
:::info From open to secured
So far all the communication between them has been in the open. They haven't secured any messages. They used asymmetric keys (public and private keys) to encrypt the pre-master key so nobody could spy on it.

Now they both generate the same 'shared secret' that they are going to use as a symmetric key.
:::
7.  **Client is ready**: The client sends a "finished" message that is encrypted with a session key.
8.  **Server is ready**: The server sends a "finished" message encrypted with a session key.
9.  **Secure symmetric encryption achieved**: The handshake is completed, and communication continues using the session keys.

All TLS handshakes make use of asymmetric cryptography (the public and private key), but not all will use the private key in the process of generating session keys. For instance, an ephemeral Diffie-Hellman handshake.

## Certificate authority (CA)


A certificate authority (CA) is a third-party organization with 3 main objectives:

- Issuing certificates
- Confirming the identity of the certificate owner
- Providing proof that the certificate is valid

You might have heard of Symantec, Comodo, or Let's Encrypt, among others. Becoming a CA is an intense task of security requirements and audits. You need to be trusted to be accepted into a root store. 

A root store is basically a database of trusted CAs. Apple, Windows, and Mozilla run their own root stores that they pre-install in your computer or device.

### Which certificate should you buy? 

There are basically 3 flavors.

- **Domain validated**. The certificate just verifies the domain name, and nothing else. You probably need this one.
- **Organization validated**. The certificate requires the validation and manual verification of the organization behind the certificate.
- **Extended validation**. The certificate requires an exhaustive verification of the business.

> All valid certificates result in the browser displaying a secure badge in the browser bar. EV certificates generally display the company name as well.


## How do certificates get validated?

When a CA issues a certificate, they sign the certificate with their root certificate pre-installed in the root store. Most of the time it's an intermediate certificate signed with a root certificate. 

:::caution Cat-astrophy case
If a cat-astrophy would occur and the root certificate is compromised, it's easier to revoke the intermediate certificates, since the root certificates are installed on each device.
:::

**Steps to validate a certificate**

1. Your browser connects to a site via HTTPS and downloads the certificate.
2. The certificate is not a root certificate.
3. Your browser downloads the certificate that was used to sign the certificate on the site.
4. But this certificate is still not the root certificate.
5. Your browser once more looks up the certificate that signed the intermediate certificate.
6. If that is a root certificate. The entire certificate chain is trusted, and thus the site certificate is trusted as well.


### Untrusted chain
In the event that the last certificate is not a root certificate, and there are no more certificates to download, the chain is untrusted.

### Why can't we self-sign your certificates?

> TL-DR; Self-signed certificates can be forged. Basically, they say 'Trust me, it's me, I promise!'. Whilist, a trusted certificate says: 'Trust me, an authority verified me'.

A self-signed certificate provides 
- the same level of encryption as one generated by an authority
- No one can spy on your data
- There is no charge to self-sign your certificates!

:::caution Yes, but no!
Almost every browser checks that the certificate is issued by a trusted authority. As such visitors are warned that the certificate cannot be trusted.

Self-signed certificates can be useful for testing, and intranets, but you should avoid using them on public sites.
