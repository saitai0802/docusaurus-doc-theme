It's kind of like when you send email data packages sent from your laptop will be attached with the local IP address labeled as sender and Youtube serverâ€™s domain name as the receiver. When packages reach the router NAT will change your local IP address to the public IP address and the router will send the modified packages to the Youtube server.
