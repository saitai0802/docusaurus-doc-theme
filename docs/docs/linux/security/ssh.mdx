## What is Hash?
- Hashing is used only to verify data
- The same input will always produce the same output
- It’s impossible to reverse it back to the original data

## Generate key for gitHub
[Generating a new SSH key pair](https://gitlab.com/help/ssh/README#generating-a-new-ssh-key-pair)
Following best practices, you should always favor **ED25519** SSH keys, since they are more secure and have better performance over the other types.

``` shell
git config --global user.name "Your Username"
git config --global user.email "Your Email"

cd ~/.ssh
# Check if any keys exsist?

#這樣在~/.ssh就會產生id_ed25519和id_rsa.pub，id_ed25519.pub就是公開的sshkey
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "email@example.com"
#Generating public/private rsa key pair.
#Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/QbsuranAlang/.ssh/id_ed25519): (直接return / 比個名尼條key)
#Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): (直接return)
#Enter same passphrase again: (直接return)
```

## Adding ssh keys for single sign-on 
``` shell
# Copy your public SSH key to the clipboard
xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
 
# Go to the host server and edit their authorized_keys
vi ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

# ========== If you have mutiple ssh keys in ~/.ssh ===================
# Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent.
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```
ssh-add adds private key identities (from your ~/.ssh directory) to the authentication agent (ssh-agent), so that the ssh agent can take care of the authentication for you, and you don’t have type in passwords at the terminal.
