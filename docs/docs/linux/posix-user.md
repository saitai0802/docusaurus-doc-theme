A POSIX user refers to a user account in a UNIX-like operating system that adheres to the POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) standard. POSIX is a set of standards defined by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) that specifies the APIs, command line interface, and various system interfaces for compatibility across different UNIX-like operating systems.

In the context of POSIX user accounts, the term "POSIX user" typically refers to a user account that conforms to the standards set by POSIX. These standards define the structure and behavior of user accounts in terms of their identification, authentication, and access privileges within the operating system.

A POSIX user account typically includes the following attributes:

1. Username: A unique name that identifies the user account.
2. User ID (UID): A numeric identifier assigned to the user account, which is used by the operating system to differentiate between different users.
3. Group ID (GID): A numeric identifier that specifies the primary group to which the user belongs.
4. Home directory: A directory where the user's files and personal settings are stored.
5. Shell: The command line interface or shell that is used by the user when interacting with the system.
6. Access permissions: POSIX users are subject to file permissions and access controls, which define their level of access to various system resources.

POSIX user accounts are commonly used in UNIX-like operating systems such as Linux and macOS, where adherence to POSIX standards ensures compatibility and consistency across different distributions or versions of the operating system.
