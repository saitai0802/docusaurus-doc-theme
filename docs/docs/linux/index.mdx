## What is the difference between Homebrew and Cask?

### Homebrew
brew is the core command for the Homebrew project.

:::note
The missing package manager for OS X

Homebrew installs the stuff you need that Apple didnâ€™t.
:::

Homebrew typically deals with command line software. Most of the software is distributed under an open source licence. See the [Formulas](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/) for a list of available installs.

`brew` [prefers pre-compiled binaries](https://docs.brew.sh/FAQ#why-do-you-compile-everything) but will compile from source in some cases

### Cask
`brew cask` is an extension to brew that allows management of graphical applications through the [Cask](https://caskroom.github.io/) project.

:::note
Homebrew Cask extends Homebrew and brings its elegance, simplicity, and speed to OS X applications and large binaries alike.
:::

Cask deals with a mixture of software and licences. The software I work on is covered by a commercial licence and available via cask.

Cask offers a way to command line manage the installation of graphical applications.
