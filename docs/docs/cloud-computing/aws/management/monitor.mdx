## Use X-ray to debug microservices specific issues

Imagine a company uses microservices-based infrastructure to process the API calls from clients, perform request filtering and cache requests using the AWS API Gateway. Users report receiving 501 error code and you have been contacted to find out what is failing. 

You may use X-Ray to debug the issue.

- CloudWatch can collect numbers and respond to AWS service-related events, but it can't help you debug microservices specific issues on AWS.
- X-Ray cannot be used to capture metrics and set up alarms as per the given use-case, so this option is incorrect.

The AWS X-Ray SDK needs permission to run in resources (like Lambda)

Create an IAM role with write permissions and assign it to the resources running your application. You can use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to grant X-Ray permissions to users and compute resources in your account. This should be one of the first places you start by checking that your permissions are properly configured before exploring other troubleshooting options.

Here is an example of X-Ray Read-Only permissions via an IAM policy:


```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "xray:GetSamplingRules",
                "xray:GetSamplingTargets",
                "xray:GetSamplingStatisticSummaries",
                "xray:BatchGetTraces",
                "xray:GetServiceGraph",
                "xray:GetTraceGraph",
                "xray:GetTraceSummaries",
                "xray:GetGroups",
                "xray:GetGroup"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```


Another example of write permissions for using X-Ray via an IAM policy:


```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "xray:PutTraceSegments",
                "xray:PutTelemetryRecords",
                "xray:GetSamplingRules",
                "xray:GetSamplingTargets",
                "xray:GetSamplingStatisticSummaries"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## CloudTail

If you have created an organization in AWS Organizations, you can also create a trail that will log all events for all AWS accounts in that organization (**need root account permission**). This is referred to as an organization trail.

- S3 related
    - By default, CloudTrail tracks only bucket-level actions. To track object-level actions, you need to enable Amazon S3 data events 
    - A bucket owner enabled CloudTrail. It doesnâ€™t mean he can see the object access logs. The bucket owner **also needs to be object owner** to get the object access logs. Otherwise, the bucket owner **must get permissions**, through the object ACL, for the same object API to get the same object-access API logs.
- Member accounts will be **able to see the organization trail**, but cannot modify or delete it. (By default, member accounts will not have access to the log files for the organization trail in the Amazon S3 bucket.)
