## AWS Firewall Manager

AWS Firewall Manager is a centralized management service for the protection of your Amazon services. The firewall manager makes it simple to implement some basic security rules on your newly created application.

As new applications are developed, Firewall Manager makes it simple to bring them into compliance by imposing a common set of security rules. You only need to configure your firewall rules once. And the service will apply them to all of your accounts and resources.

Firewall Manager comes in handy whenever you want to safeguard your entire organization rather than just a few specific accounts and resources. It also offers centralized monitoring of DDoS attacks throughout your organization.


### Usage

Using AWS Firewall Manager, you can centrally configure 
- AWS WAF rules
- AWS Shield Advanced protections
- Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) security groups
- AWS Network Firewalls
- Amazon Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall rules

across accounts and resources in your organization.
