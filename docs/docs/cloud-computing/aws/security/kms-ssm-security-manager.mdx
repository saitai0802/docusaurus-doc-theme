## KMS with EBS volume
Amazon EBS works with AWS KMS to encrypt and decrypt your EBS volume. You can encrypt both the boot and data volumes of an EC2 instance. When you create an encrypted EBS volume and attach it to a supported instance type, the following types of data are encrypted:

- At rest
    - Data at rest inside the volume
    - All snapshots created from the volume
    - All volumes created from those snapshots
- In-flight
    - All data moving between the volume and the instance

## KMS with SQS
You can choose to have SQS encrypt messages stored in both **Standard and FIFO queues** using an encryption key provided by AWS Key Management Service (KMS).

## KMS with System manager parameter store 
With AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, you can create **SecureString** parameters, which are parameters that have a plaintext parameter name and an encrypted parameter value.

### Secure String parameters vs KMS
**Secure String parameters - Only one API Call**
Parameter Store uses AWS KMS to encrypt and decrypt the parameter values* of Secure String parameters. *To retrieve the decrypted value you only need to do **one API call**. 

**KMS with SSM Parameter store - 2 API Calls**
If you encrypt first with KMS then store in SSM Parameter store,  it requires **two API calls** to get the decrypted value which is not effiecient.

### Share a CMK to users and roles in another account 

To permit the usage of a CMK to users and roles in another account, you must use **two different types of policies**:

- The key policy for the CMK must give the external account (or users and roles in the external account) permission to use the CMK. The key policy is in the account that owns the CMK.
- IAM policies in the external account must delegate the key policy permissions to its users and roles. These policies are set in the external account and give permissions to users and roles in that account.


## KMS with CodeBuild
- Q: How to make the build artifacts to be automatically encrypted at the end?
- A: Specify a KMS key to use
AWS Key Management Service (KMS) makes it easy for you to create and manage cryptographic keys and control their use across a wide range of AWS services and in your applications.

For AWS CodeBuild to encrypt its build output artifacts, *it needs access to an AWS KMS customer master key (CMK)*. 

By default, AWS CodeBuild uses the AWS-managed CMK for Amazon S3 in your AWS account. 
The following environment variable provides these details:
`CODEBUILD_KMS_KEY_ID`: The identifier of the AWS KMS key that CodeBuild is using to encrypt the build output artifact (for example, arn:aws:kms:region-ID:account-ID:key/key-ID or alias/key-alias).

## KMS with Kinesis Data Streams 
Server-side encryption is a feature in Amazon Kinesis Data Streams that automatically encrypts data before it's at rest by using an AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) you specify. 

Data is encrypted before it's written to the Kinesis stream storage layer, and decrypted after it’s retrieved from storage. As a result, *your data is encrypted **at rest** * within the Kinesis Data Streams service. This allows you to meet strict regulatory requirements and enhance the security of your data.

## KMS with CloudWatch log group
Log group data is always encrypted in CloudWatch Logs. You can optionally use AWS AWS Key Management Service for this encryption. If you do, the encryption is done using an AWS KMS (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK). Encryption using AWS KMS is enabled at the log group level, by associating a CMK with a log group, either when you create the log group or after it exists.

To associate the CMK with an *existing log group*, you can use the *associate-kms-key* command.
You can use the *create-log-group* command to associate the CMK with a log group when you *create* it.

Some other notes
After you associate a CMK with a log group, all newly ingested data for the log group is encrypted using the CMK. This data is stored in an encrypted format throughout its retention period. 
CloudWatch Logs decrypts this data whenever it is requested. CloudWatch Logs must have permissions for the CMK whenever encrypted data is requested.

### SSE-KMS vs SSE-S3
SSE-KMS is similar to SSE-S3 but comes with some additional benefits over SSE-S3. Unlike SSE-S3 you can *create and manage encryption keys yourself or you can use a default CMK key* that is unique to you for the service that is being used (S3 in this case) and the region you are working in.

When you create a CMK using KMS instead of using default CMK you get more flexibility as you can create, rotate and disable the encryption keys. As KMS is integrated with Cloudtrail with SSE-KMS you can also audit the usage of the key like when, by whom, for what purpose the key was used. You can also give separate permissions for the use of an envelope key.


## Security Manager

- Newer service, meant for storing secrets
- Capability to force rotation of secrets every X days
- Automate generation of secrets on rotation (uses Lambda)
- Integration with Amazon RDS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Aurora) 
- Secrets are encrypted using KMS
- Mostly meant for RDS integration

### SSM Parameter Store vs Secrets Manager

- Secrets Manager ($$$):
  - Automatic rotation of secrets with AWS Lambda
  - Lambda function is provided for RDS, Redshift, DocumentDB - KMS encryption is mandatory\
  - Can integration with CloudFormation

- SSM Parameter Store ($):
  -  Simple API
  -  No secret rotation (can enable rotation using Lambda triggered by CW Events)
  -  KMS encryption is optional
  -  Can integration with CloudFormation
  -  Can pull a Secrets Manager secret using the SSM Parameter Store API

### Delete an exsisting key and create a new key with the same name

When you delete a secret, the Secrets Manager deprecates it with a seven-day recovery window. This means that you can't recreate a secret using the same name using the AWS Management Console until seven days have passed. You can permanently delete a secret without any recovery window using the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).

Run the `DeleteSecret` API call with the `ForceDeleteWithoutRecovery` parameter to delete the secret permanently. If you receive errors when running AWS CLI commands, make sure that you're using the most recent version of the AWS CLI. Secrets deleted using the `ForceDeleteWithoutRecovery` parameter can't be recovered or restored.
