## When do you need the secret access key or access key ID to sign the API requests?

When you send HTTP requests to an AWS service - When you send HTTP requests to AWS, you sign the requests so that AWS can identify who sent them. You sign requests with your AWS access key, which consists of **an access key ID and secret access key**.

When you write custom code to send HTTP requests to AWS, you need to include code to sign the requests. You might do this for the following reasons:

* You are working with a programming language for which there is no AWS SDK.
* You want complete control over how a request is sent to AWS.

*You don’t need to sign when using **AWS CLI / AWS SDK** *, these tools automatically sign the requests for you with the access key that you specify when you configure the tools. When you use these tools, you don't need to learn how to sign requests yourself.



## Cognito Authentication via Cognito User Pools

You *can use* Cognito Authentication via Cognito User Pools for your Application Load Balancer 

You *can’t use* Cognito Authentication with CloudFront distribution

## Security group

> A security group acts as **a virtual firewall** that controls the traffic for one or more instances. 

The following are the default rules for **a default security group**: 
- Allow **inbound traffic** from network interfaces (and their associated instances) that are assigned to the same security group. 
- **Allows all outbound traffic**

The following are the default rules for **a security group that you create**: 
- Allows no inbound traffic
- Allows all outbound traffic

### Security Group and ENI

> TL;DR - When specifying a security group to a EC2 instance, its ENI specified the security group under the hood

Security Groups are attached to **Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs)**. That's why the console shows it under the *Networking* tab.

This design allows different security settings if there are multiple ENIs. For example, one ENI could be used for external traffic and a different ENI could be used for internal traffic.

Most Amazon EC2 instances only have one ENI, so it is easier to think of the Security Group as being associated with the instance.

### Security Group is not only for EC2 but also other services

Security Groups are not just bound to EC2 instances, in fact any resource with an ENI can have a security group attached with examples such as:

-   VPC Interface endpoints
-   RDS
-   ElastiCache
-   ElasticSearch Service
-   And many more

By having a single implementation of security group -> ENI, I would imagine it makes it easier for AWS to implement networking security for new VPC based resources over time.
