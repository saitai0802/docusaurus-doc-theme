## S3 Lifecycle

You can add rules in an S3 Lifecycle configuration to tell Amazon S3 to transition objects to another Amazon S3 Using Amazon S3 storage classes.Amazon S3 supports a waterfall model for transitioning between storage classes, as shown in the following diagram.

## Limitation

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Your applications can easily achieve thousands of transactions per second in request performance when uploading and retrieving storage from Amazon S3. Amazon S3 automatically scales to high request rates. 

For example, your application can achieve **at least 3,500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE or 5,500 GET requests per second per prefix in a bucket**.

There are no limits to the number of prefixes in a bucket. You can increase your read or write performance by parallelizing reads. For example, if you create **10 prefixes** in an Amazon S3 bucket to parallelize reads, you could scale your read performance to **55,000 read requests per second**(10*5,500 GET/HEAD).

For many purposes, it's often enough for applications to mitigate `503` SlowDown errors without having to randomize prefixes.

However, if the the limits are not sufficient, prefixes would need to be used. A prefix has no fixed number of characters. It is any string between a bucket name and an object name, for example:

- bucket/folder1/sub1/file
- bucket/folder1/sub2/file
- bucket/1/file
- bucket/2/file

Prefixes of the object 'file' would be: `/folder1/sub1/` , `/folder1/sub2/`, `/1/`, `/2/`. In this example, if you spread reads across all four prefixes evenly, you can achieve **22,000 requests per second.**

## What is prefix

In Amazon S3, you can use prefixes to organize your storage. A prefix is a logical grouping of the objects in a bucket. The prefix value is similar to a directory name that enables you to store similar data under the same directory in a bucket. When you programmatically upload objects, you can use prefixes to organize your data.

In the Amazon S3 console, prefixes are called folders. You can view all your objects and folders in the S3 console by navigating to a bucket. You can also view information about each object, including object properties.
