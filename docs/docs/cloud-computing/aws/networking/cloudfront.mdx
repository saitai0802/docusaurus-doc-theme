## Notes for exam

- What options of HTTPS are available in AWS CloudFront? 
  - Between clients and CloudFront as well as between CloudFront and origin
    via - [Viewer to Cloudfront ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.html), [Cloudfront to Origin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-cloudfront-to-custom-origin.html)
- IAM users can't create CloudFront key pairs. You must log in using **root credentials to create key pairs**.
- You can configure CloudFront to forward to your origin some or all of the cookies in viewer requests, and to cache separate versions of your objects based on the cookie values that it forwards. 
- When CloudFront returns 404 response for an object - which means the object(s) requested were not found on the origin server and the origin server generated the 404 error, which is returned by CloudFront 

## Behaviours

### Origin failover

How origin failover works: 

![](/img/aws/networking/cloudfront/failover.png)
via - [Link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/high_availability_origin_failover.html)

- CloudFront fails over to the secondary origin only when the HTTP method of the viewer request is `GET`, `HEAD` or `OPTIONS`. CloudFront does not failover when the viewer sends a different HTTP method (for example POST, PUT, and so on).
- CloudFront routes all incoming requests to the primary origin, even when a previous request failed over to the secondary origin. CloudFront only sends requests to the secondary origin after a request to the primary origin fails.

### 404 is always from origin

CloudFront always caches a few of the HTTP 4xx and 5xx status codes returned by your origin. CloudFront doesn't generate 404 responses. If a requested object isn't found in a CloudFront cache, the request is sent to the origin and the origin generates the 404 response if the object is not found on the origin server as well.

## Features

### Report

Amazon CloudFront includes a variety of reports that the Administrator can use to see usage and activity that is occurring in the CloudFront distributions.

- Popular Objects Report can determine what objects are frequently being accessed and get statistics on those objects. 
- Usage Reports tells you the number of HTTP and HTTPS requests that CloudFront responds to from edge locations in selected regions. 
- Viewers Reports can determine the locations of the viewers that access your content most frequently.

### Signed URLs

1.  In your CloudFront distribution, specify one or more trusted key groups, which contain the public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the URL signature. You use the corresponding private keys to sign the URLs.

2.  Develop your application to determine whether a user should have access to your content and to create signed URLs for the files or parts of your application that you want to restrict access to.

3.  A user requests a file for which you want to require signed URLs. Your application verifies that the user is entitled to access the file: they've signed in, they've paid for access to the content, or they've met some other requirement for access.

4.  Your application creates and returns a signed URL to the user. The signed URL allows the user to download or stream the content.

### Signed Cookies

### Origin Shield

CloudFront Origin Shield provides a centralized caching layer that sits in front of your origin to help **increase CloudFront’s cache hit ratio and collapse simultaneous requests** for the same object coming across multiple regions. As a general best practice, you should always choose the Origin Shield Region that is closest to your origin. 

![enable-origin-shield](/img/aws/networking/cloudfront/enable-origin-shield.png)

When enabled, all origin fetches coming from any CloudFront Point of Presence or Regional Edge Cache will now be routed through the Origin Shield location for a final cache check. Any content not already held in the Origin Shield location will then benefit from central request consolidation so that as little as one request goes to the origin.

## Cloudfront signers

Each signer that you use to create *CloudFront signed URLs or signed cookies* must have a public-private key pair. The signer uses its * **private key** to sign the URL or cookies*, and CloudFront uses the * **public key** to verify the signature*.

### Public Key & Private Key

When you create signed URLs or signed cookies, you use the private key from the signer's key pair to sign a portion of the URL or the cookie. When someone requests a restricted file, CloudFront compares the signature in the URL or cookie with the unsigned URL or cookie, to verify that it hasn't been tampered with. CloudFront also verifies that the URL or cookie is valid, meaning, for example, that the expiration date and time haven't passed.

### CloudFront key groups

When you use the root user to manage CloudFront key pairs, you can *only have up to **two active CloudFront key pairs** per AWS account*

Whereas, with **CloudFront key groups**, you can associate a higher number of public keys with your CloudFront distribution, giving you more flexibility in how you use and manage the public keys. By default, you can associate up to four key groups with a single distribution, and you can have up to five public keys in a key group.

## Settings

### Restricting access to files on custom origins

Reference: [Restricting access to files on custom origins](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-overview.html#forward-custom-headers-restrict-access)

If you use a custom origin, you can optionally set up custom headers to restrict access. For CloudFront to get your files from a custom origin, the files must be accessible by CloudFront using a standard HTTP (or HTTPS) request. But by using custom headers, you can further restrict access to your content so that users can access it only through CloudFront, not directly. This step isn't required to use signed URLs, but we recommend it.

To require that users access content through CloudFront, change the following settings in your CloudFront distributions:

1. Origin Custom Headers
   - Configure CloudFront to forward custom headers to your origin. See [Configuring CloudFront to add custom headers to origin requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/add-origin-custom-headers.html#add-origin-custom-headers-configure).
2. Viewer Protocol Policy
    - Configure your distribution to require viewers to use HTTPS to access CloudFront. See [Viewer protocol policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesViewerProtocolPolicy).
3. Origin Protocol Policy
    - Configure your distribution to require CloudFront to use the same protocol as viewers to forward requests to the origin. See [Protocol (custom origins only)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesOriginProtocolPolicy).

After you've made these changes, update your application on your custom origin to only accept requests that include the custom headers that you've configured CloudFront to send.

The combination of Viewer Protocol Policy and Origin Protocol Policy ensure that the custom headers are encrypted in transit. However, we recommend that you **periodically do the following to rotate the custom header**s that CloudFront forwards to your origin:

1.  Update your CloudFront distribution to begin forwarding a new header to your custom origin.
2.  Update your application to accept the new header as confirmation that the request is coming from CloudFront.
3.  When requests no longer include the header that you're replacing, update your application to no longer accept the old header as confirmation that the request is coming from CloudFront.

### Serving Static and Dynamic content

Amazon CloudFront is commonly utilized for distributing static content stored in an Amazon S3 bucket, including images, videos, and other objects. However, it offers more than that. You can leverage Amazon CloudFront to distribute dynamic content from web applications built on platforms like Ruby on Rails or PHP. 

By doing so, you can take advantage of AWS's widespread network infrastructure, ensuring fast and reliable delivery of your dynamic content to users around the world.

![](/img/aws/networking/cloudfront/static-dynamic-content.png)

If you want to split between static and dynamic content you would *create an origin for each type of content (static & dynamic) within the same distribution*. The origins can be S3 or web servers (aws instances), etc. CloudFront can serve both static and dynamic content by following these steps:

- Serving Static Content
  1. Upload your static files (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to an Amazon S3 bucket.
  2. Configure the bucket for static website hosting, specifying the index and error documents.
  3. Create a CloudFront distribution, setting the S3 bucket as the origin and configuring caching settings.
  4. Associate a domain name with the CloudFront distribution using a custom SSL certificate if needed.
  5. Update DNS records to point to the CloudFront distribution's domain name.
- Serving Dynamic Content
  1. Set up a web server (e.g., EC2 instance) or an application server (e.g., Lambda@Edge) to generate dynamic content.
  2. Configure the server to handle requests and generate appropriate responses for dynamic content.
  3. Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) or an API Gateway and integrate it with your server.
  4. Set up the ALB or API Gateway as the origin for your CloudFront distribution.
  5. Configure caching behaviors and TTLs for dynamic content based on your application's requirements.
  6. Associate a domain name with the CloudFront distribution and update DNS records accordingly.

## Trouble shooting

### Invalidating cache

If you need to remove a file from CloudFront edge caches before it expires, you can do one of the following:

- Invalidate the file from edge caches. The next time a viewer requests the file, CloudFront returns to the origin to fetch the latest version of the file.
  ![cloudfront_console_inval_example](/img/aws/networking/cloudfront/cloudfront_console_inval_example.png)
- Use file versioning to serve a different version of the file that has a different name. For more information, see [Updating existing files using versioned file names](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/UpdatingExistingObjects.html#ReplacingObjects). For example, instead of naming a graphic file image.jpg, you might call it image_1.jpg. When you want to start serving a new version of the file, you'd name the new file image_2.jpg, and you'd update the links in your web application or website to point to image_2.jpg.

### Error messages

- `The authorization header is malformed; the region '<AWS Region>' is wrong; expecting '<AWS Region>'`
  - This error indicates the configured Amazon S3 bucket **has been moved from one AWS Region to the other**. That is, deleted from one AWS Region and created with the same name in another. To fix this error, update your CloudFront distribution so that it finds the S3 bucket in the bucket's current AWS Region
