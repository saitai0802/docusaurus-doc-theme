## Behaviour

### AWS Global vs Regional vs AZ resources

Most of the AWS-managed services are regional-based services with few exceptions being Global (e.g. IAM, Route53, CloudFront, etc) or AZ bound.

- Virtual Private Cloud
  - VPC -- Regional
      - VPCs are created within a region
  - Subnet -- **Availability Zone**
      - A subnet can span only a single Availability Zone
  - Security groups -- Regional
      - A security group is tied to a region and can be assigned only to instances in the same region.
  - VPC Endpoints-- Regional
      - VPC Gateway & Interface Endpoints cannot be created between a VPC and an AWS service in a different region.
  - VPC Peering -- ~~Regional~~
      - VPC Peering can be performed across VPC in the same account of different AWS accounts ~~but only within the same region. They cannot span across regions~~
      - VPC Peering can now span inter-region
  - Elastic IP Address -- Regional
      - Elastic IP addresses created within the region can be assigned to instances within the region only.
  - Elastic Network Interface -- Availability Zone

### Some points to remember

- Regardless of the type of subnet, the internal IPv4 address range of the subnet is always private. AWS never announces these address blocks to the internet.
- By default, all subnets can route between each other without the need for any further configuration, whether they are private or public. The main route table facilitates this communication.
- If the public IP address of your instance in a VPC has been released, it will not receive a new one if there is more than one network interface attached to your instance. Reference: [Unable to access EC2 Instance over the Public IP Address](https://repost.aws/questions/QUnM1Vpq9cSS2PEhGXtlX9yA/unable-to-access-ec2-instance-over-the-public-ip-address)

### EC2 communication within AWS network

When two instances communicate using public IP addresses, the following three scenarios are possible:

- Traffic between two EC2 instances **in the same AWS Region** stays within the AWS network, even when it goes over public IP addresses.

- Traffic between EC2 instances **in different AWS Regions**
  - [**Situation 1**]: Traffic **stays within** the AWS network if there is an **Inter-Region VPC Peering connection** between the VPCs where the two instances reside.
  - [**Situation 2**]: Traffic is **not guaranteed** to stay within the AWS network where there is **no Inter-Region VPC Peering connection** between the VPCs where these instances reside.

:::infoWhat is VPC peering?

![vpc-peering](/img/aws/networking/vpc/peering-intro-diagram.webp)

Resource: [Understanding Inter-Region VPC Peering with Hands-On!](https://nileshjoshi.medium.com/understanding-inter-region-vpc-peering-with-hands-on-57b622a96c8b)

A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses. Instances in either VPC can communicate with each other as if they are within the same network. You can create a VPC peering connection between your own VPCs, or with a VPC in another AWS account. 

- The VPCs can be in different Regions (also known as **an inter-Region VPC peering connection**).
- Both VPCs for peering need to update their route table for communication
:::

## Configuration 

### 4 Configurations that are supported by the Amazon VPC console wizard 

- **VPC with a single public subnet**
  - We recommend this configuration if you need to run a single-tier, public-facing web application, such as a blog or a simple website.
- **VPC with public and private subnets (with NAT)**
  - We recommend this scenario if you want to run a public-facing web application while maintaining back-end servers that aren't publicly accessible.
- **VPC with public and private subnets and AWS Site-to-Site VPN access**
  - Plain english - can't access to the internet but allow access via Site-to-Site VPN access
  - We recommend this scenario if you want to extend your network into the cloud and also directly access the Internet from your VPC.
- **VPC with a private subnet only and AWS Site-to-Site VPN access**
  - The subnet is known as a VPN-only subnet
  - We recommend this scenario if you want to extend your network into the cloud using Amazon's infrastructure without exposing your network to the Internet.


### VPC Flow Logs

![](/img/aws/networking/vpc/vpc-flow-log.png)

Source: [Learn From Your VPC Flow Logs With Additional Meta-Data](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/learn-from-your-vpc-flow-logs-with-additional-meta-data/)

VPC Flow Logs is a feature that enables you to *capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC*. Flow log data can be published to Amazon CloudWatch Logs or Amazon S3. After you've created a flow log, you can retrieve and view its data in the chosen destination.

You can create a flow log for a VPC, a subnet, or a network interface. If you create a flow log for a subnet or VPC, each network interface in that subnet or VPC is monitored.

Flow log data for a monitored network interface is recorded as flow log records, which are log events consisting of fields that describe the traffic flow.

:::cautionFlow log is immutable
After you've created a flow log, you cannot change its configuration or the flow log record format. For example, you can't associate a different IAM role with the flow log or add or remove fields in the flow log record. Instead, you can delete the flow log and create a new one with the required configuration.
:::

### Routing table example

The following is an example of the route table for the **public subnets**, with routes for both IPv4 and IPv6. If you create IPv4-only subnets instead of dual stack subnets, your route table includes only the IPv4 routes.

| Destination | Target |
| --- | --- |
| `10.0.0.0/16` | local |
| `2001:db8:1234:1a00::/56` | local |
| 0.0.0.0/0 | `igw-id` |
| ::/0 | `igw-id` |

The following is an example of a route table for one of the **private subnets**, with routes for both IPv4 and IPv6. If you created IPv4-only subnets, the route table includes only the IPv4 routes. The last route sends traffic destined for Amazon S3 to the gateway VPC endpoint.

| Destination | Target |
| --- | --- |
| `10.0.0.0/16` | local |
| `2001:db8:1234:1a00::/56` | local |
| 0.0.0.0/0 | `nat-gateway-id` |
| ::/0 | `eigw-id` |
| `s3-prefix-list-id` | `s3-gateway-id` |

## Endpoints

![vpc-endpoints-vs-interface-endpoint](/img/aws/networking/vpc/vpc-endpoints-vs-interface-endpoint.png)

![endpoints-arch](/img/aws/networking/vpc/endpoints-arch.png)

Source: [What are VPC endpoints?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-privatelink/what-are-vpc-endpoints.html)


Endpoints are virtual devices. They are horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC components. They allow communication between instances in your VPC and services without imposing availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your network traffic.

A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by **AWS PrivateLink** without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. Instances in your VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service. Traffic between your VPC and the other service does not leave the Amazon network. There are two types of VPC endpoints: 
- interface endpoints
- gateway endpoints


![](/img/aws/networking/vpc/interface-endpoint-or-gateway-endpoint.png)

### An interface endpoint

Interface endpoint sits inside a subnet, and associated with a security group

An interface endpoint is an elastic network interface with a private IP address from the IP address range of your subnet that serves as an entry point for traffic destined to a supported service.

### A gateway endpoint

Gateway endpoint sits inside a VPC and with a route table

A gateway endpoint is a gateway that you specify as a target for a route in your route table for traffic destined to a supported AWS services (Almost all of them)

### AWS PrivateLink

> Interface endpoint and gateway endpoint are both backed by a technology called **AWS PrivateLink**

![privatelink](/img/aws/networking/vpc/privatelink.png)

Source: [Connect your VPC to services using AWS PrivateLink](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/endpoint-services-overview.html)

AWS PrivateLink enables private network connectivity between VPCs and AWS services **without using the public internet**. It establishes a secure and direct connection over the AWS network backbone, allowing VPC resources to securely access AWS services, such as Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, or AWS Lambda, privately and without exposure to the internet. 

PrivateLink ensures data privacy and reduces security risks by keeping traffic within the AWS network. It simplifies network architecture, eliminates the need for public IPs, and enhances performance and reliability by leveraging the low-latency, high-bandwidth AWS infrastructure.

:::caution
You do not need to use an internet gateway, NAT device, public IP address, AWS Direct Connect connection, or AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection to allow communication with the service **from your private subnets**. Therefore, you control the specific API endpoints, sites, and services that are reachable from your VPC.
:::

## Gateway

### Transit Gateway

AWS Transit Gateway is a service that enables customers to connect their **Amazon VPCs** and their **on-premises networks** to a single gateway. With AWS Transit Gateway, you only have to create and manage a single connection from the central gateway into each Amazon VPC, on-premises data center, or remote office across your network.

It also supports **IP Multicast**. Multicast is a communication protocol used for delivering a single stream of data to multiple receiving computers simultaneously. Transit Gateway supports routing multicast traffic between subnets of attached VPCs, and it serves as a multicast router for instances sending traffic destined for multiple receiving instances.

<Tabs className="Transit Gateway">
<TabItem value="before" label="Without AWS Transit Gateway">

![before](/img/aws/networking/tgw-before.png)
Complexity increases with scale. You must maintain routing tables within each VPC and connect to each onsite location using separate network gateways.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="after" label="With AWS Transit Gateway">

![after](/img/aws/networking/tgw-after.png)
Your network is streamlined and scalable. AWS Transit Gateway routes all traffic to and from each VPC or VPN, and you have one place to manage and monitor it all.

### Internet Gateway

> TL;DR - TO provide internet access for instnaces that have public IPs 

An Internet Gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between your VPC and the internet.

An Internet Gateway serves **two purposes**: 

-   to provide a target in your VPC route tables for internet-routable traffic 
-   to perform network address translation (NAT) for instances that have been assigned public IPv4 addresses.

To enable access to or from the internet for instances in a subnet in a VPC, you must do the following:

1.  Attach an Internet gateway to your VPC.
2.  Add a route to your subnet's route table that directs internet-bound traffic to the internet gateway. 
    - If a subnet is associated with a route table that has a route to an internet gateway, it's known as **a public subnet**. 
    - If a subnet is associated with a route table that does not have a route to an internet gateway, it's known as **a private subnet**.
3.  Ensure that instances in your subnet have a globally unique IP address (public IPv4 address, Elastic IP address, or IPv6 address).
4.  Ensure that your network access control lists and security group rules allow the relevant traffic to flow to and from your instance.

### NAT Gateway

> TL;DR - TO provide internet access for instnaces that don't have public IPs 

NAT Gateway enables private subnets within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to access the internet while keeping the instances within those subnets private and protected. The NAT Gateway acts as a gateway between the private subnet and the public internet, allowing outgoing internet traffic from the private instances and providing them with a public IP address. It simplifies the configuration and management of outbound internet connectivity, ensuring secure and controlled access for resources within the private subnets.

### Egress-only Internet Gateway

An egress-only internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows outbound communication over IPv6 from instances in your VPC to the internet, and prevents the internet from initiating an IPv6 connection with your instances.

:::caution
An egress-only internet gateway is for use with **IPv6 traffic** only. To enable outbound-only internet communication over IPv4, use a **NAT gateway** instead.
:::

In the following diagram, the VPC has both IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR blocks, and the subnet both IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR blocks. The VPC has an egress-only internet gateway.
![engress-only](/img/aws/networking/vpc/engress-only.jpg)

## Dedicated vs Hosted connection 

A dedicated connection is made through a 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps, or 100 Gbps Ethernet port dedicated to a single customer. Hosted connections are sourced from a AWS Direct Connect Partner that has a network link between themselves and AWS. 

## Direct Connect vs Site-to-Site VPN

-   **AWS Direct Connect** is an excellent choice for businesses seeking a secure, ultra-low latency, and high bandwidth connection to AWS. Although configuring AWS Direct Connect may sometimes take more time due to the physical Ethernet connection, once a connection is established, it is worth it because the network performance is easy to predict, and you can save on data transfer costs.
    - Connections go over **private network**
-   **AWS Site-to-Site VPN** is a great connection option for businesses that are just starting to use AWS. It is quick and easy to set up. But keep in mind that the VPN connection normally uses the public Internet, which may have **unpredictable performance**, and **although it is encrypted**, there may still be security concerns.
    - Connections go over **public network**

## Direct Connect + Site-to-Site VPN

![direct-connect](/img/aws/networking/vpc/direct-connect.png)

Source: [AWS Direct Connect + AWS Site-to-Site VPN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-vpc-connectivity-options/aws-direct-connect-site-to-site-vpn.html)

AWS Direct Connect is a network service that provides a dedicated and private connection between an organization's on-premises data center or office and the AWS cloud. It offers a reliable, low-latency, and high-bandwidth link, bypassing the public internet, to improve the performance, security, and cost-effectiveness of data transfer between the customer's network and AWS resources.

## Direct Connect Resiliency

AWS Direct Connect is a network service that provides an alternative to using the Internet to utilize AWS cloud services. AWS Direct Connect enables customers to have low latency and private connections to AWS for workloads that require higher speed or lower latency than the internet. Direct Connect is a paid service and is available only if the customer opts for it.

### Maximum Resiliency for Critical Workloads

Maximum resilience is achieved by separate connections terminating on **separate devices in more than one location**. This configuration offers customers maximum resilience to failure. As shown in the figure below, such a topology provides resilience to 
- device failure
- connectivity failure
- complete location failure 

You can use [AWS Direct Connect gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/direct-connect-gateways.html) to access any AWS Region (except AWS Regions in China) from any AWS Direct Connect locations.

![Redundancy-Highest](/img/aws/networking/vpc/Redundancy-Highest.png)

Source: [AWS Direct Connect Resiliency Recommendations](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/resiliency-recommendation/)


### High Resiliency for Critical Workloads

For critical production workloads that require high resiliency, it is recommended to have **one connection at multiple locations**. As shown in the figure below, such a topology ensures resilience to 
- connectivity failure due to a fiber cut or a device failure 
- a complete location failure 

You can use [AWS Direct Connect gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/direct-connect-gateways.html) to access any AWS Region (except AWS Regions in China) from any AWS Direct Connect location.

![Redundancy-Higher](/img/aws/networking/vpc/Redundancy-Higher.png)

Source: [AWS Direct Connect Resiliency Recommendations](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/resiliency-recommendation/)


### Non-Critical Production Workloads or Development Workloads

As shown in the figure below, such a topology helps in the case of *the device failure at a location* but does not help in the event of *a total location failure*.

![non-critical-direct-connect](/img/aws/networking/vpc/non-critical-direct-connect.png)

### Virtual interfaces (VIF)

![vif-propogation](/img/aws/networking/vpc/vif-propogation.png)

Source: [Virtual interfaces (VIF)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-direct-connect-for-amazon-connect/virtual-interfaces-vif.html)

You must create one of the following virtual interfaces to begin using your **AWS Direct Connect connection**.

- A public virtual interface (public VIF) enables access to public services such as Amazon S3 or Amazon Connect. 
- A private virtual interface (private VIF) enables access to your VPC and hosted workloads. 
- A transit virtual interface (transit VIF) is used to access one or more Amazon Transit Gateways associated with Direct Connect gateways.

For more information, see [AWS Direct Connect virtual interfaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/WorkingWithVirtualInterfaces.html).

## NAT 

The following diagram illustrates the architecture of a VPC with a NAT gateway. The main route table sends internet traffic from the instances in the private subnet to the NAT gateway. The NAT gateway sends the traffic to the internet gateway using the NAT gateway’s Elastic IP address as the source IP address.

![nat-gateway-diagram](/img/aws/networking/vpc/nat-gateway-diagram.png)

Source: [AWS NAT Gateways](https://easycloudsupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001916952-AWS-NAT-Gateways)

### NAT instance vs NAT gateway

These are the most 3 important points.
- **NAT instance** can be used as a bastion server
- Security Groups can be associated with a **NAT instances**
- **NAT instance** supports port forwarding

The following is a high-level summary of the differences between NAT gateways and NAT instances. We recommend that you use NAT gateways because they provide better availability and bandwidth and require less effort on your part to administer.

| Attribute            | NAT gateway                                                                                                                                                                                 | NAT instance                                                                                                                                                                      |

:::infoWhat is Bastion hosts? 
Including **bastion hosts** in your VPC environment enables you to securely connect to your Linux instances without exposing your environment to the Internet. After you set up your bastion hosts, you can access the other instances in your VPC through **Secure Shell (SSH)** connections on Linux. Bastion hosts are also configured with security groups to provide fine-grained ingress control.

You need to remember that **Bastion Hosts are using the SSH protocol**, which is a TCP based protocol on port 22. They must be publicly accessible.
:::

### NAT in multiple AZ

If you have resources in multiple Availability Zones and they share one NAT gateway, and if the NAT gateway’s Availability Zone is down, **resources in the other Availability Zones lose internet access.** 

To incrase the availability of the system, you need to create an Availability Zone-independent architecture - which means you need to create a NAT gateway in each Availability Zone and configure your routing to **ensure that resources use the NAT gateway in the same Availability Zone.**

> [NAT gateway basics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html)

## VPN

### Site-to-Site VPN Connection

Amazon VPC provides the facility to create an **IPsec VPN** connection (also known as **site-to-site VPN**) between *remote customer networks and their Amazon VPC over the internet*. The following are the key concepts for a site-to-site VPN:

- Virtual private gateway: A Virtual Private Gateway (also known as a VPN Gateway) is the endpoint on the AWS VPC side of your VPN connection.
- VPN connection: A secure connection between your on-premises equipment and your VPCs.
- VPN tunnel: An encrypted link where data can pass from the customer network to or from AWS.
- Customer Gateway: An AWS resource that provides information to AWS about your Customer Gateway device.
- Customer Gateway device: A physical device or software application on the customer side of the Site-to-Site VPN connection.


### VPN CloudHub

![AWS_VPN_CloudHub-diagram](/img/aws/networking/vpc/AWS_VPN_CloudHub-diagram.png)

Source: [VPN CloudHub](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/VPN_CloudHub.html)

There are 2 use cases that you may consider to use VPN CloudHub:

- If you have multiple AWS Site-to-Site VPN connections, you can provide secure communication between sites using the AWS VPN CloudHub.   This enables your remote sites to communicate with each other, and not just with the VPC. 
- Sites that use AWS Direct Connect connections to the virtual private gateway can also be part of the AWS VPN CloudHub.

## Elastic IP

:::cautionAuto detach public IP when attach an Elastic IP
AWS releases your instance's public IP address when you associate an Elastic IP address with it. When you disassociate the Elastic IP address from your instance, it receives a new public IP address.
:::

> EIPs are used when
- You need a static + public IP. More infor about static and public ip, please check [Static & Public IP Address](/linux/network/ip-dns/)
- You want to mask the failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address to another instance in your account.

![elastic-ip](/img/aws/networking/vpc/elastic-ip.png)

Within the AWS infrastructure, customers have virtual private clouds (VPC), within the VPCs, users have instances. So when you launch an EC2 instance, you receive a **Public IP address** by which that instance is reachable from internet. Once you stop that instance and restart the instance you get a new Public IP for the same instance. So it's basically a problem to connect your instance from internet for not having a static IP. To overcome this problem, we attach an Elastic IP to an Instance which doesn't change after you stop / start the instance.

In general, you should be good without Elastic IPs for most of the use-cases. If you're using [AWS Load Balancers](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/?tag=hotoge-20), you won't want to use Elastic IPs, as your gateway address (the last endpoint before going out to the internet) is be the Load Balancer itself, which has a static hostname (but not a static IP). The load balancer runs on AWS, and you associate it with instances based on their instance IDs, not the public IP address. But, if you're using an external CDN service like [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/), you need to use Elastic IPs, as the gateway IP is the EC2 instance's public IP.

By default, all AWS accounts are limited to five (5) Elastic IP addresses per Region, because public (IPv4) internet addresses are a scarce public resource. 

### Use case

Let’s say you setup the apache to host a website. Now, you need to scale up that machine due to any reason or you need to move that machine into another reason , you need to stop that machine. Whenever you restart again, the public ip from associated with that machine can also change. 

So it may be the case that you need to update all DNS entries again. However, You can reserve the public ip for you and that ip can be attached to any ec2 which you have, so there will be no issue regarding PUBLIC IP Change.

:::caution Cost
Elastic IP is a free service, but you’re limited to five in total (to prevent exhaustion of Amazon’s address pool). And, while they are entirely free to use, they’re actually **the only AWS service that costs money if you don’t use it**

Having an Elastic IP provisioned but not attached to a running machine will cost you $7.50 a month. Make sure your machine isn’t off for extended periods of time, and if you change servers or stop using the IP, make sure to release it so you aren’t charged for letting it sit idle in your account.

### Reallocate Elastic IP address

You can move an Elastic IP (EIP) address in AWS from one EC2 instance to another within the same region. Elastic IPs are designed to be easily reassigned and are not bound to a specific EC2 instance permanently. This allows you to maintain the same public IP address even when you stop or terminate an EC2 instance, or when you want to **associate the IP address with a different EC2 instance** for **uninterrupted service to your application**.


### How to avoid using Elastic IP

- Always think if other alternatives are available to you
- You could use a random public IP and register a DNS name to it
- Or use a Load Balancer with a static hostname


## Troubleshooting & others

### Share subnet across accounts

AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) is a service that enables you to easily and securely share AWS resources with any AWS account or within your AWS Organization. 
You can share the subnet(s) within a VPC using RAM. This will allow all EC2 instances to be deployed in the same VPC (although from different accounts) and easily communicate with one another.

To set this up, the account that owns the VPC (owner) shares one or more subnets with other accounts (participants) that belong to the same organization from AWS Organizations. 
After a subnet is shared, the participants can view, create, modify, and delete their application resources in the subnets shared with them. Participants cannot view, modify, or delete resources that belong to other participants or the VPC owner.

:::infoAWS Resource Access Manager
AWS RAM enables you to share specified AWS resources that you own with other AWS accounts. It's a centralized service that provides a consistent experience for sharing different types of AWS resources across multiple accounts.

### NACL vs Security group

- Network Access Control List
    - You can control what goes in and out of your **VPC**
    - It is an optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets. You might set up network ACLs with rules similar to your security groups in order to add an additional layer of security to your VPC.
    - Your VPC automatically comes with a modifiable default network ACL. By default, it allows all inbound and outbound IPv4 traffic and, if applicable, IPv6 traffic.
- Security groups 
    - You can control what goes in and out your **instances**
    - A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your instance to control inbound and outbound traffic. Security groups act at the instance level, not the subnet level. Therefore, each instance in a subnet in your VPC can be assigned to a different set of security groups.

### Wavelength & Carrier gateway

**AWS Wavelength** embeds AWS compute and storage services within 5G networks, providing mobile edge computing infrastructure for developing, deploying, and scaling ultra-low-latency applications.

**Some use cases of wavelength are**: Game streaming, live video and event streaming, and machine learning (ML) video inference are examples of emerging interactive applications. To ensure ultra-low latency for end-users and devices connecting via mobile networks, these workloads necessitate computing and storage close to the edge. Furthermore, use cases such as industrial automation, smart cities, IoT, and autonomous vehicles necessitate data processing and retrieval close to the edge in order to meet application performance requirements. AWS Wavelength and Wavelength Zones can help with all of these use cases.

**A carrier gateway** serves two purposes. It allows inbound traffic from a carrier network in a specific location, and it allows outbound traffic to the carrier network and internet. There is no inbound connection configuration from the internet to a Wavelength Zone through the carrier gateway.

### PrivateLink connectivity between AWS Storage Gateway and Amazon S3

1. Create a VPC endpoint for Amazon S3
2. Create a file gateway using a VPC endpoint
