## Spot Instance Interruption behaviors 

You can specify that Amazon EC2 should do one of the following when it interrupts a Spot Instance:

- Stop the Spot Instance
- Hibernate the Spot Instance
- Terminate the Spot Instance (default behavoir)


## Zonal Reserved EC2 Instance

The ability to create and manage **Capacity Reservations** independently from the billing discounts offered by Savings Plans or regional Reserved Instances.

When you purchase a Reserved Instance, you determine the scope of the Reserved Instance. The scope is either regional or zonal.

- Regional: When you purchase a Reserved Instance for a Region, it's referred to as a regional Reserved Instance. **It does not reserve capacity.**
- Zonal: When you purchase a Reserved Instance for a specific Availability Zone, it's referred to as a zonal Reserved Instance. **It reserves capacity.**

By creating Capacity Reservations, you ensure that you always have access to EC2 capacity when you need it, for as long as you need it. [Link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-capacity-reservations.html)
