## Why we need to test

Testing is essential to test the quantity of an application to meet both the functional requirements or non-functional requirements. Of course, we are able to test it manually but the problems are:
- It’s so time-consuming and easy to overlook bugs because of the human factor. 
- When we deploy new features or bug-fixing release, we may introduce more bugs and things need to be retest again

That’s why we start to automate and write them. It gives us confidence that we made no mistake in the path of a use case and the automation speeds up the whole process. Both developers and QA engineers write tests. Anyway, we still need to do manual tests because not everything can be covered with automation, so we have also QA manual testers.

### Introduction To Functional Testing

There must be something that defines what is acceptable behavior and what is not.

This is specified in a functional or requirement specification. It is a document that describes what a user is permitted to do so, that he can determine the conformance of the application or system to it. Additionally, sometimes this could also entail the actual business side scenarios to be validated.

Therefore, functionality testing can be carried out via two popular techniques:

-   Testing based on Requirements: Contains all the functional specifications which form a basis for all the tests to be conducted.
-   Testing based on Business scenarios: Contains the information about how the system will be perceived from a business process perspective.

Testing and Quality Assurance are a huge part of the SDLC process. As a tester, we need to be aware of all the types of testing even if we're not directly involved with them daily.
