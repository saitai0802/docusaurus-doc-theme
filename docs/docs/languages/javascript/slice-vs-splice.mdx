3 Differences

#### 1. Returns
`slice` returns up to but not including the second argument

`splice`  returns up to the second argument
#### 2. Mutability
`slice()` is known as an [accessor method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)  which does not modify the array but instead returns a representation via a new Array object.

`splice` is known as a [mutator method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/prototype#Mutator_methods) because it does mutate the original array.
#### 3.Number of arguments
